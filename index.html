            <h3>ECG Heartbeat Classification Using Ensemble of Efficient Machine Learning Approaches on Imbalanced Datasets</h3>

            <h5><i>Authors:</i> Md. Atik Ahamed, Kazi Amit Hasan, <b>Khan Fashee Monowar</b>, Nowfel Mashnoor; Md.

            <p>Being electrocardiogram already an established method for analyzing cardiac
                health, it gained many researchers’ interests to classify heartbeats accurately. In spite of
                having numerous works in this field, it still lacks obtaining high accuracy scores. In this
                paper, some well-known machine learning approaches are used by tuning and compared with
                other state-of-the-art related methodologies. The datasets used in this research work, are
                highly imbalanced and handled with penalizing the loss value of the Artificial Neural
                Network (ANN) by assigning class weights. Two different enriched ECG datasets are
                selected for this research. They are MIT-BIH Arrhythmia which contains five classes and
                PTB Diagnostic ECG which contains two classes. About 98.06% and 97.664% accuracy are
                achieved with proposed approaches for MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB
                Diagnostic ECG dataset respectively. Both cases this research outperforms all the other
                state-of-the-art methodologies.<a href="#"> [link]</a></p>

            <h3>Lung Opacity Classification With Convolutional Neural Networks Using
                Chest X-rays:</h3>
            <h5><i>Authors:</i> <b>Khan Fashee Monowar</b>, Md. Al Mehedi Hasan, Jungpil Shin </h5>
            <p>Chest X-ray interpretation is very crucial to detect cardiothoracic and pulmonary
                abnormalities. This time-consuming and tedious task should be error-free, fast, and reliable
                otherwise a single mistake may cause serious harm to patients. Recently, deep learning has
                achieved radiologist-level performance in chest X-ray interpretation. A CAD
                (Computer-aided detection system) can help radiologists to review chest X-rays fast and
                accurately. In our research, we trained and evaluated various deep convolutional neural
                networks (CNN) architectures to detect potential lung opacity from chest X-rays. We
                observed how strongly architectures could differentiate lung opacity from normal and other
                abnormal chest X-rays. In these circumstances, A CNN based model (Xception) achieved
                91.0% AUC along with 83.95% accuracy. Moreover, we also observed models that achieved
                a better performance on lung opacity vs normal chest X-ray classification (excluding
                abnormal class) where Xception achieved 99.1% AUC, 97.19% sensitivity, and
                95.71%accuracy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the classification
                ability of deep CNN architectures which helps to develop an automatic lung opacity detection
                system.<a href="#"> [link]</a></p>

            <h3>A Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network Model for Child Pneumonia
                Classification:</h3>
            <h5><i>Authors:</i> <b> Khan Fashee Monowar</b>, Md. Al Mehedi Hasan; Jungpil Shin</h5>
            <p>Pneumonia is still a serious threat for children including newborns. Each year
                many children died of pneumonia. Physicians diagnose pneumonia through some process
                including reviewing chest X-rays of patients. While reviewing, a single diagnostic mistake
                may cause a serious threat and do significant harm to patients. In recent years,
                Computer-aided detection system (CAD) and medical image classification are progressively turning into another research territory. CAD can reduce the physician's effort and help to
                review chest X-rays fast and error-free. Currently, Researchers build various models to detect
                pneumonia from chest X-rays. However, there is still a lack of computationally efficient
                models to diagnose pediatric pneumonia. Further, some off-the-shelf or pre-trained models
                are not always suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications since these models are
                not lightweight. In our research, a lightweight convolutional neural network model was built
                from scratch using basic building blocks which able to learn lung texture features and detect
                pediatric pneumonia. Our proposed model performance was compared with some
                off-the-shelf models. The proposed model achieved the best AUC (99.0%), test accuracy
                (94.6 %), F1 (94.7 %), precision (93.2 %) and specificity (93.1%) scores. Moreover, Several
                data augmentation algorithms were employed to increase the model's classification ability.<a href="#"> [link]</a></p>
